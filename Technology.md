# Technologies and Resources Utilized

## Data Analysis / Review / Cleanup
___________________________________


- PANDAS

For this segment of the project we felt that the most useful tool to implement here would be PANDAS using Python as it is a natural fit for our data as it is already in a csv format and can be moved into a PANDAS dataframe with ease. This will give us the best path for data review, cleaning and analysis.




## Database Storage
___________________

- Postgress SQL

Our datasets are very structured and have many points with which we can join data tables. This is the reason we chose to use Postgress. We need a structured database with the ease of control to merge or create calculated fields. 




## Machine Learning
___________________

We have decided that a Linear Regression model would be ideal for the prediction we are trying to achieve with our health data.




## Dashboard
____________

- Tableau
  - HTML
  - JavaScript


We plan on building dynamic charts and plots with the data from our model within Tableau. We are looking to then embed those charts into a webpage using HTML and Javascript.
