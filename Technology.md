# Technologies and Resources Utilized
_______________________



## Data Analysis/Review/Cleanup
_______________________________

-PANDAS
For this segment of the project we felt that the most useful tool to implement here would be PANDAS using Python as it is a natural fit for our data as it is already in a csv format and can be moved into a PANDAS dataframe with ease. This will give us the best path for data review, cleaning and analysis.



## Database Storage
___________________

-Postgress SQL
Our datasets are very structured and have many points with which we can join data tables. This is the reason we chose to use Postgress. We need a structured database with the ease of control to merge or create calculated fields. 



## Machine Learning

TBD: currently being reviewed by the team. This field will be updated no later than 11/30/2022



## Dashboard
____________

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Tableau

Currently we are looking at a webpage to house our dashboard. Tableau would be the tool to create the actual Dashboard based information charts. This would be embedded into an HTML page and from there we will use JavaScript and event listeners to give the page user input fields that will allow them to change the visualizations based on the criteria they have selected.
